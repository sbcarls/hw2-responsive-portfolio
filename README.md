# hw2-responsive-portfolio

This homework assignment was to create a responsive website with 3 pages: "About Me", "Portfolio", and "Contact Me." I created 3 html documents, named them to match their respective pages, and changed their titles so they would appear correctly within the browsers tabs. I also created a CSS stylesheet and linked to all 3 html docs. I linked bootstrap CSS and Javascript to all 3 pages, as well as googledocs to change the font on the pages.  I added a background image to the pages to enhance the look. I tried but was unable to successfully add a footee bar, but I will do this at a later time. I was also unable to wrap the text next to my photo on my "About Me" page, this will also be done at a later time. Other things I plan on changing: size and style of cards on page, actual portfolio links and photos, as well as adding my social media links.
